# 1. Basic Idea

Students shall program robots to navigate a pre-defined parcours.
With given hardware specifications (Praktikumsplattform), students should implement
robot localization, task following and navigation.

We provide them with a well-defined environment that they should use.
The goal is for the students to integrate their work into the given system.
